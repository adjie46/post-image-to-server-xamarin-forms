You can use this plugin to select an image on the device (see usage on the README.md):

https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/MediaPlugin

The file is type MediaFile.

Then, install Microsoft.Net.Http from Nuget to your PCL and platform projects. You can do the upload like this:

private MediaFile _image;

// code here to assign image to _image

var content = new MultipartFormDataContent();
content.Add(new StreamContent(_image.GetStream()), "\"file\"", $"\"{_image.Path}\"");

var httpClient = new System.Net.Http.HttpClient();
var url = "http://upload.here.io/folder/subdir";
var responseMsg = await httpClient.PostAsync(url, content);
